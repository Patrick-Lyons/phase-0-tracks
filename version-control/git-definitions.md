# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
 - Version control allows you to have a history of every iteration--version--of a project you are woking on, with these saved versions always accessible to revisit. It is useful to avoid or fix bugs, keep work from being erased, and to have multiple versions cooking at the same time with out conflict.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
 - Branches are modified versions of the master file. You would use one to work on the content of the master file and make changes with out actually affecting the master file until need be.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
 - A commit is a save point for versions of a project, a point that you can roll a project back to. A good commit message is a cogent description of the commit's changes.

* What is a merge conflict?
 - A merge conflict is a situation where two branches make changes to the same content. To merge successfully, the conflict needs to be dealt with (one change is decided upon).
