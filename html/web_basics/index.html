	<h1>What super power would I realistically want?</h1>
	<p>I'm going to rank super powers based on personal taste, but there are too many out there so I'll add a constraint to keep it managable. I'll say the pool of super powers is limited to those exhibited by the core Justice League heroes and each power will be isolated (i.e., Superman has multiple powers). Caveat: I don't know this subject well.</p> 

	<p>As far as I know, the League is comprised of: Superman, Batman, Wonderwoman, Aquaman, Flash, Green Lantern, the Martian, Hawk Lady (?), and finally Alfred</p>
	<h2>The Powers</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Flight</strong> <small><em>(Superman, Wonderwoman, Green Lantern, Martian, Hawk)</em></small></li>
		<li><strong>Super Strength</strong> <small><em>(Superman, Wonderwoman, Alfred [he lifts and hits his macros])</em></small></li>
		<li><strong>Above Average Intelligence</strong>e <small><em>(Batman, Alfred)</em></small></li>
		<li><strong>Laser Eyes</strong> <small><em>(Superman)</em></small></li>
		<li><strong>Ice Breath</strong> <small><em>(Superman [I feel like people forget he has this])</em></small></li>
		<li><strong>Ghost</strong> <small><em>(the Martian)</em></small></li>
		<li><strong>Super Fast</strong> <small><em>(Flash)</em></small></li>
		<li><strong>Super at Swimming</strong> <small><em>(Aquaman)</em></small></li>
		<li><strong>Fish Whisperer</strong> <small><em>(Aquaman)</em></small></li>
		<li><strong>Snarky</strong> <small><em>(Alfred)</em></small></li>
	</ul>
	<p>Note that Greenlantern doesn't have any powers, because it's all the ring.</p>
	<h3>Top Three Powers</h3>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Above Average Intelligence</strong> because that seems to have the most utility. Could be used for things like avoiding typos and spelling mistakes in a website you make about super powers.</li>
		<li><strong>Super Strenght</strong> so I could buy more groceries per trip and not worry about the walk home.</li>
		<li><strong>Super Fast</strong> and I would only JUST BARELY set world records for marathons. I wouldn't want to go way over board and give away how fast I really was, that would invite too much interest from people. I'd hate to end up locked away in some secret military base for testing.</li>
	</ol>
