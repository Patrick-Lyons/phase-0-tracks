	- bedroom = ["bed", "desk", "mirror"]
Example 2: list of people in a group.

4. Hash is like an array, but each item has two parts: key and value. Keys will be writting in symbols or other data classes.

5. Example 1: grocery list with quantity.
	- groceries = {apples: 2, oranges:3, grapes: 12}
example 2: people and their favorite ice cream flavor.
	- favorite_flavors = {jared: vanilla, tom: chocolate, sally: strawberry}
